Music Mashup - Your tasteful resource for music knowledge!

## What's it all about?

Once upon a time, I built a site as part of a university project, to answer 
the question of: `"Is it viable to create a personalised user web experience, 
with the use of data scraping and feeds?"`. The idea was to gather 
information from various data sources and **mash** them together to create a 
personalised web experience. Given my love for all things music, I thought it 
would be a good opportunity to create a **music mashup** (see what I did 
there?).

Over half a decade later though, the technology is outdated and various 
data sources/API's are no longer working/available. This is simply a side 
project to return it to its former glory, test out some new technology, learn 
a couple new things and gauge how I've improved as a Web Developer. Maybe even 
collaborate if anyone is interested in doing so.

## Where can I find the original?

The original site can be found at: [http://carlhamilton.co.uk/work/music-mashup]
(http://carlhamilton.co.uk/work/music-mashup). Don't expect too much from it 
though, as it no longer works...
